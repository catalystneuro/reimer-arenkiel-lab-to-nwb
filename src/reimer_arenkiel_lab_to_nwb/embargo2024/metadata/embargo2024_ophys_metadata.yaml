      manufacturer: ThorLabs
  TwoPhotonSeries:
    - name: TwoPhotonSeriesGreenChannelFOV1
      description: FOV1 refers to the left part of the original ScanImage acquisition. To maximize frame rates in each imaging session, fields of view were defined for acquisition that included a single plane visualizing only the dorsal surface of bilateral OBs (1800 um long x ~600um wide fields of view that were tiled to cover a total field of view that was 1800-2500 um wide). Images were acquired continuously throughout experiments (during odor presentations, intertrial, and inter-block intervals), with 5um/pixel resolution at the fastest possible frame rate allowed by the imaging parameters (15-18 Hz).

    - name: TwoPhotonSeriesGreenChannelFOV2
      description: FOV2 refers to the central part of the original ScanImage acquisition. To maximize frame rates in each imaging session, fields of view were defined for acquisition that included a single plane visualizing only the dorsal surface of bilateral OBs (1800 um long x ~600um wide fields of view that were tiled to cover a total field of view that was 1800-2500 um wide).

      description: FOV3 refers to the right part of the original ScanImage acquisition. To maximize frame rates in each imaging session, fields of view were defined for acquisition that included a single plane visualizing only the dorsal surface of bilateral OBs (1800 um long x ~600um wide fields of view that were tiled to cover a total field of view that was 1800-2500 um wide).
